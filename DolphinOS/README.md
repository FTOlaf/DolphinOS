	DolphinOS is a 32-bits Operating system, i will plan to support 64-bits CPU. 
	I use ubuntu OS to write the C code.
	gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9).
	the OS can run on the bochs virual machine(X86 platform).
	The OS be install in floppy disk. you need to pay attention to the bochsrc file, if you can't run DolphinOS.
	In version 0.03B, the OS do not enter the vbe2.0 display mode.
